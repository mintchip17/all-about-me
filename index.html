        <h1 id="heading1">General information!</h3>
        <p id="par1">Hello! I'm Annaya. I'm a middle schooler and I love math and science. I also have a younger brother who never fails to entertain me. In the future, I hope to be some kind of graphic design/coding engineer. I love music - especially singing and dancing. Not to mention, I am a huge fan of mint!</p>

        <h1 id="heading2">More info - what do I like to do?</h3>
        <p id="par2">I really love coding and graphic designing, as you can probably already tell. I also love playing tennis - it's so fun, is a great form of exercise, and is very satisfying! I'm more of a logical person, as I really enjoy math and all the concepts that go into it. I also am part of the tennis team, Mathcounts, and science olympiad club. I spend most of my day listening to music (even when doing everything) and really enjoy singing and dancing along to choreographies.</p>
